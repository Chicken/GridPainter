# GridPainter

Stupid online game inspired by the game jwiggs did for 10^2 jam 3.  
Reason for making was to create a verification system (anti cheat) and online leaderboard.  
Probably full of holes to cheat the system. Might also have a lot of false positives.

I got tired of making this and kinda rushed the end... probably won't be updating this anymore.
